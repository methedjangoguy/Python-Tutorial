It's a good practice to use virtual environments for your Python projects to manage dependencies.

### For Both Windows and Mac:

1. Creating Virtual Env 
- On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv \path\to\env_name
```
- On macOS:
```bash
python -m venv .\path\to\env_name
```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```bash
\path\to\env_name\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS: 
```bash
source env_name/bin/activate    
```
